Introduction
------------

JSCommunicator is a SIP communication tool developed in HTML and JavaScript.

Please see http://jscommunicator.org for more details about features,
examples, mailing lists and the latest source code.

Requirements
------------

To use JSCommunicator, you require a SIP proxy that supports the
SIP over WebSockets transport.

Only recent versions of the SIP proxies support WebSockets.

Install
-------

Use http://bower.io/ to install dependencies 

Do `bower install`
  

Use cases
---------

 * Standalone:
   - include the HTML fragment into a static HTML page,
     possibly using Server Side Includes (SSI).  Make sure the
     page references all the required JavaScript source files.

 * In a CMS, wiki or other publishing platform:
   - include the HTML fragment into a block in a page
     managed by a CMS.  Configure the CMS to send the JavaScript to
     the user or include <script> tags within the content body with
     the phone fragment.

Integration
-----------

ArbiterJS is used to provide a loosely-coupled mechanism for integration
with other JavaScript modules used in the same page/site.

For example, you can:

 * send a signal to JSCommunicator telling it which destination to dial

 * receive notifications from JSCommunicator when calls are made
   or received and use this information to query or update an
   address book or CMS, display related information about the caller
   in another part of the screen, etc

For an example, see the files:

 event-demo.shtml
 event-demo.js

Credits
-------

JSCommunicator is based on the JsSIP library and inspired by the
TryIt.jssip.net and RetroRTC demo applications produced by Versatica.
